# Camera Calibration

This code was made to supplement the claibration tools touch designer files we built. This would grab a handful of pictures using checker board grids to determine the distortion of the webcam we were using. We could then take the values that it returned to us and input them into some of the distortion nodes in our networks to account for the lens distortion on our physical camera.
